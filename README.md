GitHub-Raw-Preview-Chrome-Extension
===================================

Directly view GitHub raw HTML/CSS/JS in Chrome

This Chrome Extension intercepts js, css, and html files on raw.github.com and changes the default content-type from text/plain so that the browser will properly render them, rather than just showing plain text.
